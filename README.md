# Design Patterns

Create simple examples of using main templates. Implementation on Java language.

## Three types of templates : Behavioral, Creational and Structural

### - Behavioral - describe interactions between objects and focus on how objects communicate with each other. They shift your focus away from flow of control to let you concentrate just on the way objects are interconnected.

* Chain of Responsibility - decouples the sender of request and it's receiver. Simplyfies objects because they doesn't  have to know the chains structure.
